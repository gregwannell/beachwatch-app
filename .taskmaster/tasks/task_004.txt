# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement UK Geographic Regions Data Management
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create data models, API routes, and services for managing UK geographic regions with jsonb geometry data integration using Supabase JavaScript client
# Details:
Create API routes in app/api/regions/ for fetching region data using Supabase client. Implement direct Supabase queries for hierarchical region structure (country > county > unitary authority) leveraging built-in REST API. Create region service functions for data transformation handling existing jsonb geometry fields containing GeoJSON Polygon objects. Implement caching strategy with React Query and Supabase's built-in connection pooling. Add region boundary coordinate validation for jsonb polygon data. Handle geometry field structure: {"type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [[[lng, lat], [lng, lat], ...]]}. IMPORTANT: Use correct database schema field names - `name_id` in annual_region_aggregates table, `additional_area_cleaned_m` (not additional_areas_cleaned_m), and `parent_id` in regions table (not parent_region_id). Work with existing jsonb geometry field data for all 226 UK regions with complete boundary coverage across 4 hierarchy levels.

# Test Strategy:
Test region data fetching with various geographic levels using Supabase client. Validate jsonb GeoJSON Polygon structure and coordinate integrity. Test region hierarchy queries for parent/child relationships using Supabase REST API. Verify API performance with large boundary datasets leveraging built-in connection pooling. Test queries against production schema using correct field names (name_id, additional_area_cleaned_m, parent_id). Test jsonb polygon coordinate processing for map rendering with existing complete boundary data.

**Implementation Complete - Comprehensive Supabase Region Queries System**

Successfully implemented full hierarchical region query system with RegionQueries class in region-queries.ts featuring findRegionsByParent, getRegionHierarchy, searchRegionsByName, getRegionPath, getRegionsByType, getRegionStatistics, and validateHierarchy functions. All queries properly use parent_id field and include efficient hierarchy building with Maps for O(1) lookups, descendant counting, and circular reference detection.

Created corresponding React Query hooks in use-region-queries.ts with complete cache management, query key factories, prefetch helpers, and mutation support. System includes comprehensive error handling, performance optimization, and flexible query options (includeGeometry, includeChildren, includeParent, includeAggregates, maxDepth, orderBy). Enhanced RegionWithRelations interface provides full type safety for hierarchical data structures.

All queries leverage Supabase's built-in REST API, connection pooling, and query builders for optimal performance with the existing UK regions dataset containing jsonb geometry fields.
