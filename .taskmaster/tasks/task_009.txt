# Task ID: 9
# Title: Build Engagement Statistics Panel
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the engagement statistics panel showing survey counts, volunteer numbers, and total beach length surveyed
# Details:
Create EngagementStatsPanel component with responsive design. Display key metrics: number of surveys, volunteer count, total surveyed beach length. Implement real-time updates when filters change using React Query. Add metric comparison with previous period (year-over-year changes). Create loading skeletons for better UX. Add thousand/million number formatting (e.g., 1.2K, 1.5M). Use card-based layout with icons from Lucide React. Position fixed on right side (desktop) or below map (mobile). Include subtle animations for metric updates.

# Test Strategy:
Test panel updates when filter changes occur. Verify responsive positioning across different screen sizes. Test metric calculation accuracy and formatting. Validate loading states and error handling.
