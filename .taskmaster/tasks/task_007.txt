# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Filter System and State Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Build simplified filtering system with region selector, time period controls, and litter category filters using local state management
# Details:
Create simple filter state using useState hooks for UI state management. Implement RegionSelect component with search functionality using shadcn/ui Select and Command components. Build YearRangePicker component supporting single year and year ranges using slider or input components. Create CategoryCheckboxes component for litter type and source filtering. Add simple reset functionality to clear all filters. Integrate with existing React Query hooks for data fetching without additional complexity. Focus on core functionality without URL synchronization, localStorage persistence, or advanced debouncing - leveraging React Query's built-in caching for performance.

# Test Strategy:
Test filter combinations and proper state updates. Verify filter reset functionality works correctly. Test integration with React Query data fetching. Validate filter performance with React Query caching.
