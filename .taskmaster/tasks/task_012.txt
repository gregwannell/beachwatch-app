# Task ID: 12
# Title: Performance Optimization and Production Deployment Setup
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement production-ready optimizations, error handling, monitoring, and deployment configuration for Vercel and Supabase
# Details:
Configure Next.js production optimizations: image optimization, bundle analysis, and code splitting. Implement proper error boundaries with user-friendly error pages. Add performance monitoring with Web Vitals tracking. Set up Sentry or similar for error tracking (optional). Configure Vercel deployment with proper environment variables. Set up Supabase production database with proper security rules. Add database connection pooling and query optimization. Implement proper CSP headers and security configurations. Add sitemap.xml and robots.txt. Configure analytics tracking (Google Analytics 4). Add proper TypeScript strict mode configurations.

# Test Strategy:
Test production build performance with Lighthouse audits. Verify error handling in production environment. Test deployment process and rollback capabilities. Validate security headers and CSP configurations. Monitor Core Web Vitals metrics.
